 <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>

 <p>I like how the story is somehow fictitious but in a way a realism of how the human mind works when at war. I like how they showed the differences in worlds of the privileged and not and is on survival mode for the rest of their lives.</p>

 <h3>Prison Break</h3>

 <p>I like how unhinged the series is but can also show depth on the characters and their flaws.</p>
